# Timezones' Reliability Assessment

* [`early_year_variations.py`](`early_year_variations.py`) calculates metrics like standard deviation and entropy of timezones' commits for each year.
    Run `python early_year_variations.py`

* [`count_timezone_commits.bash`](count_timezone_commits.bash) calculates the number of commits per timezone for a given year.
    Run `python count_timezone_commits.bash <year>`
